# homer-ng
Just a mashup of [angular.js](http://angularjs.org), [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org), [Google Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/intro), [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/) and [Geometry Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geometry).

Also including localstorage and `navigator.getPosition()`.

We are also using a small part of a comprehensive [geodesy library](https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy) for degree conversion.
